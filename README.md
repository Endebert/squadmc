# SquadMC
SquadMC is a map-based mortar elevation and bearing calculator for [Squad](http://joinsquad.com/)

 * created using [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
 * elevation calculation taken from [squadcalc.com](https://squadcalc.com/) (github repository [here](https://github.com/lorenmh/sc-react))
 * Keypad grid originally based on [Leaflet.SimpleGraticule](https://github.com/ablakey/Leaflet.SimpleGraticule), but not much is left from the original code

Special thanks to the people over at[https://www.airpressuretendency.net/fcsquad/squadmaps/](https://www.airpressuretendency.net/fcsquad/squadmaps/)! Their interactive maps were the inspiration for this project.
